  This document contains the instructions for preparing a camera-ready
  manuscript for the proceedings of NAACL HLT 2012. The document itself conforms
  to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of what
  your manuscript should look like.  Authors are asked to conform to
  all the directions reported in this document.  Also included are instructions for
  submission to the conference, which are similar to the camera-ready instructions
  but remove author-identifying information.

\section{Introduction}

This paper details our experiments in using Statistical Machine translation methods for 
error detection in English as part of the Conll-13 challenge. The challenge involved 
correction of errors made by Singaporean students of English.

\section{Problem Background: Types of error}
\indent We begin by motivating the approach we take by considering the problem in a little more depth. Two of the most common types of error are article errors and preposition errors. 
Article errors are most common for speakers of languages which themselves lack any sort of article 
(some very common examples are Chinese, Japanese, and Russian), though they are naturally present 
in the writings of most all students. Similarly, preposition errors account for a large number of 
errors, due to the vast complexity of the English preposition system. Preposition use is highly particular, 
and is often governed by the context in which the preposition appears (making it a good candidate for 
phrase based correction). \newline

\indent An additional major source of error is that of collocation (or idiomatic) errors. These 
arise when there is a strong association between words even though other choices might be semantically 
or syntactically correct (for example, strong computer makes sense, but powerful computer is idiomatically 
rendered). Additionally, this type of error encompasses stock idiomatic phrases where the individual words 
are not obviously related to the actual meaning (to “hit the nail on the head”, to “kick the bucket”, etc). 
These phrases are usually non-modifiable in many contexts or cannot be modified and retain their meaning 
unless great care is used. While rule-based approaches lead to extremely complex definitions, a 
statistical approach is well suited to collocation errors since it provides an easy and concrete way 
of taking into account the relationships between words and/or whole idiomatic phrases. \newline

\section{Baseline}

\section{Baseline problems}
\indent The baseline displayed atrocious performance across the board. Two major and easily observable 
issues arise: the number of useless phrases in the phrase table, and the bias of phrases towards not 
making changes. \newline
\indent Firstly, we note that the vast majority of phrases in the phrase table are entirely unhelpful 
in decoding. For example, the number of possible translations of "(" is obscenely large, having hundreds
of entries. Of these, only a handful are useful, and even then the most common substitution should still 
be "(", as no errors using the left paren character occur anyway. This happens for virtually every piece 
of punctuation and trivial phrase, and does nothing except slow down decoding and cause spurious translation 
issues during decoding. We deal with a solution to this in the phrase table pruning section. \newline
\indent A second issue is that the phrase table entries are biased towards not making changes when 
decoding happens. That is, for a given phrase, the phrase table causes there to be a much larger chance 
of said phrase remaining unchanged in the final product, rather than changing and potentially correcting 
an error. A fairly typical PT entry indicative of this issue is: \newline
\newline
\indent , according to ||| , according to the ||| 0.166667 0.99065 0.0384615 0.578006 2.718 ||| 0-0 1-1 2-2 ||| 6 26 1 \newline \newline
\indent , according to ||| , according to ||| 0.961538 0.99065 0.961538 0.986281 2.718 ||| 0-0 1-1 2-2 ||| 26 26 25 \newline \newline
\indent We note here that the bottom phrase (which makes no changes) has a probability of 
0.961538, while the top phrase has a probability of 0.0384615. We talk about our approach to this 
in the section on downsampling. \newline

\section{General Instructions}

Manuscripts must be in two-column format.  Exceptions to the
two-column format include the title, as well as the 
authors' names and complete
addresses (only in the final version, not in the version submitted for review), 
which must be centered at the top of the first page (see
the guidelines in Subsection~\ref{ssec:first}), and any full-width
figures or tables .  Type single-spaced.  Do not number the pages.
Start all pages directly under the top margin.  See the guidelines
later regarding formatting the first page.

%% If the paper is produced by a printer, make sure that the quality
%% of the output is dark enough to photocopy well.  It may be necessary
%% to have your laser printer adjusted for this purpose.  Papers that are too
%% faint to reproduce well may not be included.

%% {\bf Do not print page numbers on the manuscript.}  Write them lightly
%% on the back of each page in the upper left corner along with the
%% (first) author's name.

The maximum length of a manuscript is eight (8) pages for the main
conference, printed single-sided, plus two (2) pages for references
(see Section~\ref{sec:length} for additional information on the
maximum number of pages).  Do not number the pages.

The review process is double-blind, so do not include any author information (names, addresses) when submitting a paper for review.  However, you should allocate space for the names and addresses so that they will fit in the final (accepted) version.  This is best done by either providing fake or blank names and addresses (as shown in this paper).

\subsection{Electronically-available resources}

NAACL HLT provides this description in \LaTeX2e{} ({\tt naaclhlt2012.tex}) and PDF
format ({\tt naaclhlt2012.pdf}), along with the \LaTeX2e{} style file used to
format it ({\tt naaclhlt2012.sty}) and an ACL bibliography style ({\tt naaclhlt2012.bst}).
These files are all available at
{\tt http://naaclhlt2012.org}.  A Microsoft Word
template file ({\tt naaclhlt2012.dot}) is also available at the same URL. We
strongly recommend the use of these style files, which have been
appropriately tailored for the NAACL HLT 2012 proceedings.


\subsection{Format of Electronic Manuscript}
\label{sect:pdf}

For the production of the electronic manuscript you must use Adobe's
Portable Document Format (PDF). This format can be generated from
postscript files: on Unix systems, you can use {\tt ps2pdf} for this
purpose; under Microsoft Windows, you can use Adobe's Distiller, or
if you have cygwin installed, you can use {\tt dvipdf} or
{\tt ps2pdf}.  Note 
that some word processing programs generate PDF which may not include
all the necessary fonts (esp. tree diagrams, symbols). When you print
or create the PDF file, there is usually an option in your printer
setup to include none, all or just non-standard fonts.  Please make
sure that you select the option of including ALL the fonts.  {\em
  Before sending it, test your {\/\em PDF} by printing it from a
  computer different from the one where it was created}. Moreover,
some word processor may generate very large postscript/PDF files,
where each page is rendered as an image. Such images may reproduce
poorly.  In this case, try alternative ways to obtain the postscript
and/or PDF.  One way on some systems is to install a driver for a
postscript printer, send your document to the printer specifying
``Output to a file'', then convert the file to PDF.

For reasons of uniformity, Adobe's {\bf Times Roman} font should be
used. In \LaTeX2e{} this is accomplished by putting

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage{latexsym}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
in the preamble.

Additionally, it is of utmost importance to specify the {\bf
  US-Letter format} (8.5in $\times$ 11in) when formatting the paper.
When working with {\tt dvips}, for instance, one should specify {\tt
  -t letter}.

Print-outs of the PDF file on US-Letter paper should be identical to the
hardcopy version.  If you cannot meet the above requirements about the
production of your electronic submission, please contact the
publication chairs above  as soon as possible.


\subsection{Layout}
\label{ssec:layout}

Format manuscripts two columns to a page, in the manner these
instructions are formatted. The exact dimensions for a page on US-letter
paper are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Left and right margins: 1in
\item Top margin:1in
\item Bottom margin: 1in
\item Column width: 3.15in
\item Column height: 9in
\item Gap between columns: 0.2in
\end{itemize}

\noindent Papers should not be submitted on any other paper size. Exceptionally,
authors for whom it is \emph{impossible} to format on US-Letter paper,
may format for \emph{A4} paper. In this case, they should keep the \emph{top}
and \emph{left} margins as given above, use the same column width,
height and gap, and modify the bottom and right margins as necessary.
Note that the text will no longer be centered.

\subsection{The First Page}
\label{ssec:first}

Center the title, author's name(s) and affiliation(s) across both
columns (or, in the case of initial submission, space for the names). 
Do not use footnotes for affiliations.  Do not include the
paper ID number assigned during the submission process. 
Use the two-column format only when you begin the abstract.

{\bf Title}: Place the title centered at the top of the first page, in
a 15 point bold font.  (For a complete guide to font sizes and styles, see Table~\ref{font-table}.)
Long title should be typed on two lines without
a blank line intervening. Approximately, put the title at 1in from the
top of the page, followed by a blank line, then the author's names(s),
and the affiliation on the following line.  Do not use only initials
for given names (middle initials are allowed). Do not format surnames
in all capitals (e.g., ``Bangalore,'' not ``BANGALORE'').  The affiliation should
contain the author's complete address, and if possible an electronic
mail address. Leave about 0.75in between the affiliation and the body
of the first page.

{\bf Abstract}: Type the abstract at the beginning of the first
column.  The width of the abstract text should be smaller than the
width of the columns for the text in the body of the paper by about
0.25in on each side.  Center the word {\bf Abstract} in a 12 point
bold font above the body of the abstract. The abstract should be a
concise summary of the general thesis and conclusions of the paper.
It should be no longer than 200 words.  The abstract text should be in 10 point font.

{\bf Text}: Begin typing the main body of the text immediately after
the abstract, observing the two-column format as shown in 
the present document.  Do not include page numbers.

{\bf Indent} when starting a new paragraph. For reasons of uniformity,
use Adobe's {\bf Times Roman} fonts, with 11 points for text and 
subsection headings, 12 points for section headings and 15 points for
the title.  If Times Roman is unavailable, use {\bf Computer Modern
  Roman} (\LaTeX2e{}'s default; see section \ref{sect:pdf} above).
Note that the latter is about 10\% less dense than Adobe's Times Roman
font.

\subsection{Sections}

{\bf Headings}: Type and label section and subsection headings in the
style shown on the present document.  Use numbered sections (Arabic
numerals) in order to facilitate cross references. Number subsections
with the section number and the subsection number separated by a dot,
in Arabic numerals. 

{\bf Citations}: Citations within the text appear
in parentheses as~\cite{Gusfield:97} or, if the author's name appears in
the text itself, as Gusfield~\shortcite{Gusfield:97}. 
Append lowercase letters to the year in cases of ambiguities.  
Treat double authors as in~\cite{Aho:72}, but write as 
in~\cite{Chandra:81} when more than two authors are involved. 
Collapse multiple citations as in~\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}.

\textbf{References}: Gather the full set of references together under
the heading {\bf References}; place the section before any Appendices,
unless they contain references. Arrange the references alphabetically
by first author, rather than by order of occurrence in the text.
Provide as complete a citation as possible, using a consistent format,
such as the one for {\em Computational Linguistics\/} or the one in the 
{\em Publication Manual of the American 
Psychological Association\/}~\cite{APA:83}.  Use of full names for
authors rather than initials is preferred.  A list of abbreviations
for common computer science journals can be found in the ACM 
{\em Computing Reviews\/}~\cite{ACM:83}.

The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly fit the
American Psychological Association format, allowing regular citations, 
short citations and multiple citations as described above.

{\bf Appendices}: Appendices, if any, directly follow the text and the
references (but see above).  Letter them in sequence and provide an
informative title: {\bf Appendix A. Title of Appendix}.

\textbf{Acknowledgment} sections should go as a last (unnumbered) section immediately
before the references.  

\subsection{Footnotes}

{\bf Footnotes}: Put footnotes at the bottom of the page. They may
be numbered or referred to by asterisks or other
symbols.\footnote{This is how a footnote should appear.} Footnotes
should be separated from the text by a line.\footnote{Note the
line separating the footnotes from the text.}  Footnotes should be in 9 point font.

\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the
paper near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if
possible.  Wide illustrations may run across both columns and should be placed at
the top of a page. Color illustrations are discouraged, unless you have verified that 
they will be understandable when printed in black ink.

bibliography & 10 pt & \\
footnotes & 9 pt & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{font-table} Font guide. }
\end{table}

{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each one
sequentially in the form:  ``Figure 1. Caption of the Figure.'' ``Table 1.
Caption of the Table.''  Type the captions of the figures and 
tables below the body, using 10 point text.  

\section{Length of Submission}
\label{sec:length}

The NAACL HLT 2012 main conference accepts submissions of long papers
and short papers.  The maximum length of a long paper manuscript is
eight (8) pages of content and two (2) additional pages of references
\emph{only} (appendices count against the eight pages, not the
additional two pages).  The maximum length of a short paper manuscript
is four (4) pages including references.  For both long and short
papers, all illustrations, references, and appendices must be
accommodated within these page limits, observing the formatting
instructions given in the present document.  Papers that do not
conform to the specified length and formatting requirements are
subject to be rejected without review.

\section{Double-blind review process}
\label{sec:blind}

As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. In addition, please do not post your submissions on the web until after the review process is complete.
